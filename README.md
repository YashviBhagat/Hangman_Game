# Hangman Game
This is a Python-based implementation of the classic Hangman game. The objective is for players to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. Features include:

Random word selection from a predefined list.
Visual representation of the word as underscores, updated with correct guesses.
Tracking of incorrect guesses with a maximum number of allowed wrong attempts.
A simple and interactive command-line interface. This project is a great example of Python's control flow and string manipulation, providing a fun way to learn basic programming skills.
